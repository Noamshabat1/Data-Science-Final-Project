Sounds like a crime … <SEP> Indeed, it is essential to reduce the budget deficit to match economic growth! We will get the 2026 deficit to ~3% of GDP. Sensible deregulation will ensure that economic growth is ~3% or higher.

However, corruption sticks out like a sore thumb in an efficient system. <SEP> Um … what? Is this definitely real? If so, very concerning. <SEP> Whoa! <SEP> It might make sense to increase compensation for Congress and senior government employees to reduce the forcing function for corruption, as the latter might be as much as 1000 times more expensive to the public <SEP> Scott’s voice of reason is like music <SEP> European justice is broken <SEP> Many countries are disappearing.

Government funding to “non-governmental” organizations goes through various money-laundering shell companies until reaching guys like Raskin. <SEP> Hundreds of federal workers are being promoted daily every time we encounter excellence. The team will be more clear about this. The goal is to make the federal government a meritocracy as much as possible. <SEP> There is a shortage of top notch air traffic controllers. If you have retired, but are open to returning to work, please consider doing so. <SEP> Maybe people in Santa Monica should consider voting Republican? 🤷♂️ <SEP> Out of touch with reality, to say the least <SEP> If all people see is the legacy media, they are living in a fake reality.

They used “helping people” as cover. <SEP> True <SEP> All government spending is taxation. This point really needs to be hammered home. Whatever is not directly taxed is taxed in the form of inflation, as the government prints more money. Inflation is the worst tax of all, as it punishes those who are just barely making ends <SEP> True <SEP> A more accurate measure of GDP would exclude government spending. Otherwise, you can scale GDP artificially high by spending money on things that don’t make people’s lives better. For example, you could shift everyone who is building cars to working at the DMV.
